# conform
Language: Python; Optimized a program that finds the least moves to flip caps the same way.

Given a list of people's who's caps are either forward (F) or backward (B), return a shout that tells the minimal amount of intervals to flip their caps.
Improved a given program (conform.py) by simplifying the two pass into a single pass, removing repetitive code, and incorporating a neutral third input (bareheaded "H").
