Language: Python; Optimized a program that finds the least moves to flip caps the same way.

Given a list of people's who's caps are either forward (F) or backward (B), return a shout that tells the minimal amount of intervals to flip their caps.
Improved a given program (please_flip_original()) by simplifying the two pass into a single pass (please_flip_streamlined()), removing repetitive code (please_flip_streamlined()), and incorporating a neutral third input (please_flip_bare()).
